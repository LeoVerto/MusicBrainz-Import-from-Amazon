# MusicBrainz: Import from Amazon

Import album data from Amazon to add a new release on MusicBrainz.

## Description

The script adds a button on Amazon pages (that contain a music album) which allows you to create a new release from the data present on the page.

*Note: I've began using this script as I get all the releases I want on Amazon. Expect updates.*
